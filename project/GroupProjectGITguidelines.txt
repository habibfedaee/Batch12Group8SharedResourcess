----------------------TeamMember & Teamlead--------------------------------------------------------
You will clone the repo from your repo!the link to github will already be esatblished
so you dont need to create any locla repo or establish any link!!!!!


1.clone the repo on your local system
!!!when u clone you have only the main branch!!!
!!!please download the Submain branch!!!

2.Create a new branch from subMain and start working .
!!!make sure u make commits before you switch a branch or upload to github!!!

3.Make commits and upload the code in your OWN BRANCH on GITHUB

Once you are done working on a particular task and you want to merge to SubMain

1.Goto github
2.Open a pull request

Open up the pull request
review it, make sure the code is correct!!!
take the person who opened the pull request on zoom!!

You can use either strategy
1.Review code , resolve conflicts and merge on github 
OR
2.Download the branch you want to merge on your system, test it, merge on local and update the remote!

Use what ever you want


-----------After Submain has the whole Project--------------------------------------------------------

Only team lead will open a pull request to merge Submain with main branch and assign it to syntax technologies!



Something improtant if you are merging on local!!!

If u are making a 3 way merge and there is no conflict, git may want you to make a new merge commit on your local!
it will open a VIM editor!
you just need to put a commit message and save editor

how to use vim editor :
