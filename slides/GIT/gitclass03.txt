Review::
tracking our project using GIT
1.create a new project
navigate to the location where u want to create your repo

a.create a repo
git init

b.track src
git add src

c.add to repo
git commit -m "message"


do I have to do git commit after each modification?

code for calculator in java
funcitonality of addition--->then u will make a commit
functionlity of subtraction-->then u will make another commit

exceptions-->funcitonaloty of squareroot(functionality isnt complete)-->add to repo


Use case of staging area:

lets add it to staging area
lets try to resolve after that




git add . --> track all the file (add them to staging area) in the working directory


what will be the scenario in which we may need git add . ???
you may need to track all files in the project...

once in start when u create a new repo:
git remote -v --> check connection of local with remote
no output means no connection

git remote add origin URL --> connect the local to remtoe repo
git branch -M main


git push -u origin main-->sync local with remote
